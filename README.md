# Peer Assessment Application - SOEN 341

## Objective
The purpose of this project is to familiarize ourselves with software development. To achieve this, we will work as a team and combine our skills to deliver a finished product. Following the Agile process, the project is divided into four sprints, and at the end of each sprint, we are responsible for demonstrating our work.

## Description of the Project
The Peer Assessment System will be a web-based platform designed to facilitate the evaluation of student contributions. Each student will assess the performance and participation of their teammates in their group. There will also be a section for instructors, allowing them to view evaluations and form groups while tracking the overall score of each group. 

Each student and instructor must authenticate themselves by providing an email and password to log into their account. After logging in, they will access the assessment page. The assessment will be based on four dimensions: **Cooperation**, **Conceptual Contribution**, **Practical Contribution**, and **Work Ethic**. Each dimension will be rated on a 7-point scale, with an additional comment section for more detailed feedback.

### Evaluation Dimensions
1. **Cooperation**: Evaluate how well a team member collaborates with others by attending meetings, communicating, and being willing to help.
   
2. **Conceptual Contribution**: Assess the quality and creativity of the ideas a team member brings to the project, including problem-solving skills and innovative thinking.

3. **Practical Contribution**: Measure the tangible work delivered by a team member, such as coding, designing, conducting research, reviewing others' work, and providing feedback.

4. **Work Ethic**: Evaluate the respect team members have towards each other, including punctuality and overall commitment throughout the project.

## Problems That Might Arise
### Problem: Bias in Peer Evaluation
There might be unfair ratings based on personal relationships or group conflicts.

**Solution**: The assessment will be anonymous, which will help reduce bias.

### Problem: Confusion with the System
Students or instructors might find it difficult to navigate the platform.

**Solution**: We will ensure that the platform is user-friendly, with clear instructions for both instructors and students.

### Problem: Managing Peer Assessments for Many Groups
This could pose challenges for instructors.

**Solution**: Implement data visualization, providing visual dashboards or summary reports of group performance.
