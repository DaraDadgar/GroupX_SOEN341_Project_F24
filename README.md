# Peer-Assesment-Application-SOEN-341

Team Members and roles:
 - Oren Argot: 40224072 - Working on the front-end

Objective - 
  The purpose of this project is to familiarize ourselves with software development. In order to do so, we have to work as a team and combine our skills to have a finished product. Since we are following the agile process, the project is divided into four sprints, and at the end of each sprint, we are responsible to show a demo of our work. 

Description of the project - 
  The peer Assessment System will be a web-based platform designed to facilitate the evaluation of student contributions. Each student will be able to assess the performance and participation of the teammates in their group. There will also be a section for the instructor, where they will be able to see the evaluation of each student and they will also be able to form the groups and see the overall score of each group. Each student and instructor will have to authenticate themselves by providing an email and password to log into their account. They will then be able to access the assessment page. The assessment will be based on four dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. Each dimension will be based on a 7-point scale and a comment section so they can add more details.
  
  Cooperation: Evaluate how well a team member collaborates with others by attending meetings, communicating, and being willing to help.

  Conceptual Contribution: Assesses the quality and creativity of the ideas a team member brings to the project. This includes problem-solving skills and being able to        think outside the box to solve difficulties.

  Practical Contribution: Measures the tangible work delivered by a team member: coding, designing, doing research reviewing others, and providing feedback.

  Work Ethic: Evaluate the respect team members have towards each other. Also punctuality and the commitment of a team member throughout the project.
  
  
Problems that might arise - 
  Problem: Bias in peer evaluation, there might be unfair ratings based on personal relationships or group conflict.
  Solution: The assessment will be made anonymous and that will reduce bias.

  Problem: Confusion with the system. Students or instructors might find it difficult to navigate the system.
  Solution: We will ensure that the platform is simple to use and has clear instructions for both of the users (instructor and Students).

  Problem: Managing peer assessments for many groups. This could cause an issue for the instructors.
  Solution: Data visualization, providing visual dashboards or a summary report of the group performance.
