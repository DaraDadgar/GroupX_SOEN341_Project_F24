# Peer Assessment Application - SOEN 341

Team Members and roles:

- Oren Argot: 40224072 - Working on the front-end

Objective -
The purpose of this project is to familiarize ourselves with software development. In order to do so, we have to work as a team and combine our skills to have a finished product. Since we are following the agile process, the project is divided into four sprints, and at the end of each sprint, we are responsible to show a demo of our work.

Description of the project -
The peer Assessment System will be a web-based platform designed to facilitate the evaluation of student contributions. Each student will be able to assess the performance and participation of the teammates in their group. There will also be a section for the instructor, where they will be able to see the evaluation of each student and they will also be able to form the groups and see the overall score of each group. Each student and instructor will have to authenticate themselves by providing an email and password to log into their account. They will then be able to access the assessment page. The assessment will be based on four dimensions: cooperation, conceptual contribution, practical contribution, and work ethic. Each dimension will be based on a 7-point scale and a comment section so they can add more details.

Cooperation: Evaluate how well a team member collaborates with others by attending meetings, communicating, and being willing to help.

Conceptual Contribution: Assesses the quality and creativity of the ideas a team member brings to the project. This includes problem-solving skills and being able to think outside the box to solve difficulties.

3. **Practical Contribution**: Measure the tangible work delivered by a team member, such as coding, designing, conducting research, reviewing others' work, and providing feedback.

4. **Work Ethic**: Evaluate the respect team members have towards each other, including punctuality and overall commitment throughout the project.

## Problems That Might Arise

### Problem: Bias in Peer Evaluation

There might be unfair ratings based on personal relationships or group conflicts.

**Solution**: The assessment will be anonymous, which will help reduce bias.

---

### Problem: Confusion with the System

Students or instructors might find it difficult to navigate the platform.

**Solution**: We will ensure that the platform is user-friendly, with clear instructions for both instructors and students.

### Problem: Managing Peer Assessments for Many Groups

This could pose challenges for instructors.

**Solution**: Implement data visualization, providing visual dashboards or summary reports of group performance.
